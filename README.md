# Book-List
Book List is my 7th app in the Android Development journey.
========================================================
Book List app uses Network permissions and parses JSON from GOOGLE api books,
and displays it in a ListView.
--------------------------------------------------------
So, it combines the use of
* ListView layout
* Network permissions, validating internet connection
* AsyncTask implementation
* JSON parsing
* Custom List Adapter implementation
* Loaders
